# Admin Addon User Manager Plugin

The **Admin Addon User Manager** Plugin is for [Grav CMS](http://github.com/getgrav/grav). A simple admin panel extension which adds the option to manage users and groups.

If you are using `>= Grav v1.7.0`, then please use the built-in interface for managing accounts and groups.

## Installation

Installing the Admin Addon User Manager plugin can be done in one of two ways. The GPM (Grav Package Manager) installation method enables you to quickly and easily install the plugin with a simple terminal command, while the manual method enables you to do so via a zip file.

### GPM Installation (Preferred)

The simplest way to install this plugin is via the [Grav Package Manager (GPM)](http://learn.getgrav.org/advanced/grav-gpm) through your system's terminal (also called the command line).  From the root of your Grav install type:

    bin/gpm install admin-addon-user-manager

This will install the Admin Addon User Manager plugin into your `/user/plugins` directory within Grav. Its files can be found under `/your/site/grav/user/plugins/admin-addon-user-manager`.

### Manual Installation

To install this plugin, just download the zip version of this repository and unzip it under `/your/site/grav/user/plugins`. Then, rename the folder to `admin-addon-user-manager`. You can find these files on [GitHub](https://github.com/d-vid-szab-/grav-plugin-admin-addon-user-manager) or via [GetGrav.org](http://getgrav.org/downloads/plugins#extras).

You should now have all the plugin files under

    /your/site/grav/user/plugins/admin-addon-user-manager

> NOTE: This plugin is a modular component for Grav which requires [Grav](http://github.com/getgrav/grav) and the [Admin](https://github.com/getgrav/grav-plugin-admin) plugin to operate.

## Configuration

Before configuring this plugin, you should copy the `user/plugins/admin-addon-user-manager/admin-addon-user-manager.yaml` to `user/config/plugins/admin-addon-user-manager.yaml` and only edit that copy.

Here is the default configuration and an explanation of available options:
